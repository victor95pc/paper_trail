# Migrations often contain long up/down methods, and extracting smaller methods

# The Ruby Style Guide recommends to "Limit lines to 80 characters."
# (https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#80-character-limits)
# but 100 is also reasonable.
Metrics/LineLength:
  Max: 100

# The number of lines in a method is not a useful metric compared to `AbcSize`.
# It's common to have very long methods (> 50 lines) which are quite simple. For
# example, a method that returns a long string with only a few interpolations.

Style/AlignParameters:

# Please use semantic style, e.g. `do` when there's a side-effect, else `{}`.
# The semantic style is too nuanced to lint, so the cop is disabled.

# Use double negation wherever it would otherwise be impractical to convert
# a value to an actual boolean.
Style/DoubleNegation:

# The decision of when to use a guard clause to improve readability is subtle,
# and it's not clear that it can be linted. Certainly, the default
# `MinBodyLength` of 1 can actually hurt readability.
Style/GuardClause:

# Use postfix (modifier) conditionals for one-liners, unless doing so would
# exceed 60 characters.
Style/IfUnlessModifier:

# The Ruby Style Guide says:
#
# > Use \ instead of + or << to concatenate two string literals at line end.
#
# but in my experience the `\` style is rarely used and less readable. Please
# concatenate multiline strings with `+` or use a HEREDOC.
Style/LineEndConcatenation:
  Enabled: false

# Using `module_function` instead of `extend self` would make the instance
# methods in these modules private. That would be a breaking change, so these
